          PyGObject provides a convenient wrapper for the GObject+ library for use in Python programs,
          and takes care of many of the boring details such as managing memory and type casting.
          When combined with PyGTK, PyORBit and gnome-python, it can be used to write full featured
          Gnome applications.
